## Usage

To run `make` in your `~/code/my-ledger-app` project dir:

```
docker run -v ~/code/my-ledger-app:/code cryptoxic/ledger-sdk
```

If you're already in your project dir you can just do:

```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/code cryptoxic/ledger-sdk
```

To run an arbitrary command in your project dir:

```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/code cryptoxic/ledger-sdk 'make clean'
```

This repo was forked from lukechilds' github and updated by me. I will try to keep the SDK, Clang and GCC up to date as much as I can.
